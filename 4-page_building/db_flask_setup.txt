Open git bash and activate your python kernel.
Example:  conda activate PythonData

Then type in python <path to hosting.py>
On my machine, I have the project on my C:\, so I type in:
python /c/Project_3/4-page-building/hosting.py

That should startup http://127.0.01:8000

Type that into your favorite browser to test the website and the api calls.
